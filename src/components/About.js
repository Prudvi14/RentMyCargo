      <p>
        Founded in 2024 by Prudvi Gadeshula, Rent My Cargo has come a long way from its beginnings in LPU.
        When Prudvi first started out, their passion for providing efficient and eco-friendly cargo rental 
        solutions drove them to do tons of research and gave them the impetus to turn hard work and 
        inspiration into a booming online store. We now serve customers all over India and are thrilled to 
        be a part of the quirky, eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the cargo rental industry.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        <h4>Bike Rentals</h4>
        <p>
          At Rent My Cargo, we offer a variety of bike rentals, including popular models from 
          Royal Enfield and Yamaha. Our featured models include:
          <ul>
            <li>The Royal Enfield Classic 350, available for ₹1,000 - ₹2,000/day.</li>
            <li>The Yamaha FZ series, also available for ₹1,000 - ₹2,000/day.</li>
          </ul>
          Renting a cargo bike not only provides an eco-friendly alternative to cars but also enhances maneuverability in urban areas while accommodating children and pets.
        </p>
        <h4>Car Rentals</h4>
        <p>
          Our car rental options cater to a wide range of needs and budgets. We offer models from:
          <ul>
            <li>Tata</li>
            <li>Mahindra</li>
            <li>MG</li>
            <li>Suzuki</li>
          </ul>
          Typical daily rates range from ₹2,000 to ₹5,000 depending on the class of vehicle—whether it’s an economy model or a luxury SUV. Additional costs may include insurance, fuel, and mileage fees. Renting a car offers flexibility for those who need reliable transportation without the commitment of ownership.
        </p>
        <h4>Truck Rentals</h4>

            <li>Mahindra</li>
          </ul>
          Small trucks can be rented starting at ₹4,000/day plus mileage, while larger moving trucks (10-15 ft) typically begin at ₹10,000/day plus mileage. As with car rentals, additional fees may apply for insurance and equipment rentals like dollies or moving pads. Our truck rental options are ideal for moving furniture or transporting goods across town.
